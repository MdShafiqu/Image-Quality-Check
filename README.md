# Image Quality Check
We have utilised ~1,000 images and built a simple CNN to recognise image quality (good or bad), followed by converting the CNN model into TFLite format suitable for edge applications. To run the Python script convert_cnn_tflite_code.py, first install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. If the codes successfully run, it will convert and save the TFLite model, which can later be tested using any TensorFlow Lite template on Android Studio.
